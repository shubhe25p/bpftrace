Demonstrations of biosnoop, the Linux BPF/bpftrace version.


This traces block I/O, and shows the issuing process (at least, the process
that was on-CPU at the time of queue insert) and the latency of the I/O:

# ./biosnoop.bt
Attaching 5 probes...
TIME(ms)     DISK             COMM             PID    LAT(ms)
9811         sd               kworker/u12:2    7815   1
30294        sd               btrfs-transacti  526    3
30294        sd               btrfs-transacti  526    3
30294        sd               btrfs-transacti  526    3
30294        sd               btrfs-transacti  526    3
30294        sd               btrfs-transacti  526    3
30294        sd               btrfs-transacti  526    3
[...]

This output shows the btrfs-transaction process was issuing block I/O, which were
completing with around 3 milliseconds of latency. Each block I/O event is
printed out, with a completion time as the first column, measured from
program start.

There is another version of this tool in bcc: https://github.com/iovisor/bcc
The bcc version provides more fields.
